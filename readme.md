# Important Insights
1. The game is one of the real life application of pathfinding algorithm {Bellman-Ford Algorithm in this case}. The algorithm is used to deduce the path for the imposter to automatically reach out to the player. As the player changes its position the path also changes dynamically.
2. The game is inspired from "among us". The characters are somewhat similar to the ones in actual game. The game has a lighting feature which can be turned on or off by pressing '+'.
3. There are different tasks in the game whose completion will lead to the termination of the game along with displaying "You Won".
4. The Code follows OOPS approach.
